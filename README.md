# Data Collected through Wizarding World / Potterverse
Potterbot is not an official organisation and is not linked to Wizarding World nor does it have any ties to it.
You should be happy to know that Potterbot does not collect any private information through account merging and collects unidentifiable information, the only identifiable information is your discord id.
The only data collected through linking is:
 - House Name
 - Patronus
 - Wand Core
 - Wand Wood
 - Wand Size
 - Date Joined

This is the only data saved on our servers and all other data is from discord and how you interact with the bot itself
Keep in mind that you should be careful to give out your Bearer token in a public chat as it may grant access to attackers that can rack up your personal information, things such as your name, email address, date of birth, country of residence and UUID can be leaked by just the Bearer Token (This applies for discord as well!) But Potterbot does not collect, save, or utilise any of these details.
No data is being sold, bought, collected or traded by Potterbot through your account merging. And your Bearer Token is also disregarded after initial setup.

# Data Collected through bot use (Discord)
Potterbot itself does not save any messages to the database unless it is explicitly a usable command, you can check all the commands by doing .help
Potterbot does not host your data through it's own servers but uses a trusted provider to host the database and bot, in any circumstance where Discord / Wizarding World is leaked, the bot will go down and all data will be wiped for user safety and privacy.

# Source Code
PotterBot source code will most likely never be open source or available to the public, this is because the inner workings of the bot contain code that can easily be misused by non trusted individuals and can put all users at risk, for that reason, the source code is not open source, and most likely will never be, this also applies for the database, Potterbot will never sell your info, collect real life identifiable data or residence and we promise to stay like that for the entire time. If for some reason you'd wish to delete your discord id and wand info off our servers, please reach out to me at ads#2000 on discord!

# Anything else?
If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me, at ads#2000, keep in mind, I am the only actual developer of Potterbot (PotterBot#9824), and all other bot's that doesn't share the same name and tag are fakes.
